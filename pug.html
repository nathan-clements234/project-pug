			<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>

			<p>The Pug is a compact companion dog for people of all ages. These dogs are a perfect exapmle of a breed designed to do nothing useful, except be a companion. These dogs developed in ancient China, but progressively moved west into Europe, and into the Americas in the 19th century.</p>

				<p>Calm and watchful, the Pug is loyal and friendly. This dog is perfect for families because of their low aggresiveness, and known for being a companion dog. Pug puppies are very active and playful, but they mellow out with age. They tend to chew and nip at objects during this phase of their lives. With training and socialization, these dogs will be a loyal companion.</p>

				<p> This dog has a lifespan of 12 to 15 years. Since Pugs lack longer snouts and prominent skeletal brow ridges, they are susceptible to eye injuries such as proptosis, scratched corneas, and painful entropion. Pugs that live a mostly sedentary life can be prone to obesity, though this is avoidable with regular exercise and a healthy diet. The minor diseases that the dog is likely to suffer from are "reverse sneezing" which causes them to quickly  gasp and snort. Reverse sneezing episodes are usually not harmful, and massaging the dog's throat or covering its nose in order to make it breathe through its mouth can often shorten a sneezing fit</p>

				<p>Some people mistakenly believe that it does not really matter what a dog eats, that they will eat just about anything given to them and that their stomachs can handle all types of foods. The Pug is prone to weight gain and even a pound can make a big difference for a dog that often has breathing problems that extra weight can exasperate.  This dog, however, loves fruits such as bananas,apples, and pears. Vegetables such as carrots, broccoli, and squash will help keep you dog healthy and happy.</p>
